execeve should go in the child

bc if w/e execve doesnt it will quit?

spawn a child and have the parent wait

--

after it does execv in the loop
	no more child in the loop
		so break; after execv

--------
2,3,4

write up a fork tree
-
upon fork() <- right here is where both processes exist

if(fork() == 0)
	child
else if
	parent
 
so both processes will check to see if fork is 0
	child will return 0
	parent will return child ID
